# TODO: Biblical commentary handling

Need to determine how to handle biblical commentaries in the YAML schema:
- How to tag sections by biblical book?
- Should each biblical book be a separate section?
- How to handle loci for commentaries (tag by theological topic, by book, or both)?

## Files to revisit
- `gomarus-commentaries-gospels.yaml` — Commentaries on Matthew, Luke & John
- `gomarus-commentaries-epistles.yaml` — Commentaries on Romans & Galatians
