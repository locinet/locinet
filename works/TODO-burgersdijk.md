# TODO: Burgersdijk - An Idea of Philosophy, both Moral & Natural

## Issues
- PDF TOC extraction and WebFetch both fail to read PDF contents
- Need to investigate why `npm run pdf-toc` and WebFetch can't extract text from RBO PDFs
- Once readable, list all chapters starting with "Chapter I. On the Definition, Certainty, Student, and Division of Moral Philosophy"

## Work details
- Author: Franco Burgersdijk (Q1442647)
- Latin title: Idea Philosophiae tum Moralis tum Naturalis
- PDF: https://reformedbooksonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Burgersdijk-Francis-An-Idea-of-Philosophy-both-Moral-and-Natural-Moral-Philosophy-only.pdf
